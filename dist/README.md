# Production Build

⚠️ **Important:** This folder should be generated by running `npm run build`

## To create a fresh production build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized production files in this directory using Vite.

## Automatic Deployment

When you push to GitHub, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build the project
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

The `dist` folder in git serves as a fallback and should be updated before each publish.
